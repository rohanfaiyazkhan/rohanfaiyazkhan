# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @rohanfaiyazkhan

I recently graduated with a Masters in Computing from Queen‚Äôs University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada in January 2023. 

Previously I have worked as a Frontend web developer for [Xen Works](https://xen.works/) and have 2 years of industry experience in this role. 
Over my early career I have had the fortune of working under brilliant team leads who have drilled into me the importance of clean, readable and 
maintainable code. I like to think of myself as framework agnostic and have strong enough fundamentals in basic web technologies 
that I can quickly adapt to whatever framework is needed (or lack thereof). I also care deeply about UI/UX and hope to create a more accessible web. 
Currently I am focusing on expanding my skillset learning about Data Analytics and AI.

Technologies I currently work with are __React, Express.js, Next.js, Svelte, SvelteKit__ with either __Javascript or Typescript__. I am also familiar with __Python, Flask, TesnorFlow, Pytorch, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks__. I have worked with cloud platforms include AWS and Azure, CICD pipelines, Cloudflare and Netlify.

üöÄ I am currently looking for work in Canada in Software Engineering or Frontend Development roles.
